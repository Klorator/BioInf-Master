Structure bioinformatics - Lab 2 Notes
----------------------------------------

Q1: How would you qualify the protein based on the 
    secondary structure content (all-alpha, 
    all-beta, or mixed alpha-beta)?
Answer: Mixed alpha-beta


Q2: How many domains does the structure contain, 
    and do they have the same topology or are 
    their folds different?
Answer: Two domains, consisting of four beta-sheets 
    and a few alpha-helixes each. Topology is the same.


Q3: Why does Molprobity decide that some residues 
    should be flipped?
Answer: Because Asn, Gln, and His are often oriented 
    wrong in crystallography. So their orientation
    is recalculated to reduce steric clashes.

    - A 75 ASN

Q4: How many residues in the structure are located 
    outside the allowed regions?
Answer: Three residues are Ramachandran outliers.
    - 57 Pro (-112.7, 164.2)
    - 69 Leu (125.5, 79.5)
    - 92 Val (159.8, 144.6)


Q5: Based on the MolProbity analysis, does ProX 
    resemble a protein? Is it worth analyzing further?
Answer: It looks terrible!


Q6: How often is Dali database updated? Which databases 
    are used by DALI? What are the differences between 
    heuristic and exhaustive searches? Pros and cons.
Answer: Dali is updated weekly. It uses PDB and
    AlphaFold DB databases.
        Heuristic searches are faster because it makes
    good guesses on where to look and skips other parts.
    Exhaustive searches look everywhere but are slower.


Q7: When was the PDBeFold webpage last updated? 
    Do you think this is recent enough? Figure 5.2 
    will help you answer this question.
Answer: Last version update was 2014. Not many new folds
    have been added since then.


Q8: What types of scores (e.g., Q-score, P-score, 
    Z-score) are used to rank hits, and how do they 
    differ in evaluating structural similarity, 
    statistical significance, and alignment quality?
Answer: 
    Q-score indicates C-alpha alignment. Includes 
        alignment length and RMSD. Higher is better.
    P-score indicates probability of achieving a 
        better match by chance. Includes RMSD, 
        n-aligned residues, n-gaps, n matched secondary
        structures elements. Higher is better.
    Z-score indicates statistical significance following
        a Gaussian distribution. Higher is better.


Q9: What is the sequence identity between 1po6 and 
    the query, and how does its Z-score reflect the 
    significance and quality of the structural match?
Answer: 
    Seq. ident. = 65 %
    Z-score = 15.3, (+2 => 2 SD over mean)


Q10: How many matches did the DALI server yield 
    against PDB25 (a non-redundant subset of 
    structures with <25% sequence identity) and PDB90 
    (>90% sequence identity)? Do these numbers align 
    with the expected differences between the databases?
Answer: 
    Dali matches to PDB25 = 342
    Dali matches to PDB90 = 524
    The PDB90 database is larger, so more hits 
    are expected.

Q11: How do you explain the different number of hits 
    between PDBeFold and Dali?
Answer: PDBeFold matches = 28
    While there haven't been many new folds since 2014,
    the number of proteins cataloged has increased.


Q12: What is the most probable function of our 
    mysterious protein?
Answer: "HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN"
    RNA-binding in the nucleus.


Q13: Is the amino acid located in the core or on the 
    surface of the protein? How well does it fit the 
    electron density map? Compare its position and fit 
    to residues in the "blue area" of the protein.
Answer: Surface/facing outwards.
    The blue areas seem to have more electron density,
    with electrons inside the structure.


Q14: Was Arg 97 built into the structure in a wrong way 
    or are there objective reasons that make building 
    of this residue difficult?
Answer: Maybe? 


Q15: What is the name used for the domain that is 
    found in the hnRNP core protein A1? How many 
    “architectures” of this domain are there?
Answer: "hnRNP A1, RNA recognition motif 1 (IPR034845)"
    There are 8000 architectures.


Q16: What is the function of the hnRNP core protein A1? 
    Navigate through the Structure tab in UniProt and 
    explore the list to visually compare the 
    AlphaFold DB structure with the X-ray structures. 
    What are the differences?
Answer: Packaging of pre-mRNA, transport of poly(A) mRNA
    from nucleus to cytoplasm, modulation of splice sites.
    Difference was a big loop.


Q17: How many and which residues are within hydrogen 
    bonding distance?
    Answer: Ten residues
    - Lys 15
    - Gly 20
    - Asp 42
    - Arg 55
    - Glu 85

    - Lys 87
    - Arg 88
    - Val 90
    - Arg 92
    - Ser 95


Q18: What amino acid types (hydrophobic, +1 charge, 
    -1 charge …) mediate the interaction?
Answer: 


Q19: Are the hydrogen bonds formed mainly by sidechain 
    or backbone atoms?
    Answer: 


Q20: Would you bet that our protein X could bind 
    nucleic acids? (motivate your answer)
