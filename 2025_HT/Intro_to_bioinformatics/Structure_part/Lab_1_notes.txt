Lab 1 -- PyMol Basics

Q1. Write down the one-letter abbreviations for 
    amino acids 15, 35, 37, 53, 118, 130, 150, 28, 132 and 136 
    in the 1a6n structure. Which word do they form?

Alanin (A15), Serine (S35), Proline (P37),
A53, Arginine (R118), A130, Glycine (G150),
Isoleucine (I28), Asparagine (N132), Glutamic acid (E136)

Answer: ASPARAGINE


Q2. How many α-helices and how many β-strands can you find in myoglobin?

Answer: 8 a-helices and 0 b-strands.


Q3. Locate the helix around amino acid 65. 
    Which are the first and the last amino acids of this helix?

Answer: First = E59, Last = K78


Q4. Can you determine the direction (N->C) of this α-helix? 
    Hide the cartoon and show lines, color by element. 
    How are the backbone carbonyl groups oriented in relation 
    to the direction of the helix? How are the side chains 
    oriented in relation to the direction of the helix?

Answer: It goes from K78 to E59 => N->C
    Backbone carbonyls point towards the C-direction.
    Side chains point outwards from the a-helix.


Q5. Explain why α-helices are polar. It may help you to look 
    at the figure below. Can you find any capping residues 
    that stabilize the partial charges at the ends of the helix?

Answer: The *inside* of an a-helix is always polar due to the
    carbonyl and nitrogen in the backbone. These enable the h-bonds
    which form the helix.
    Capping residues: N-terminal = E59 & D60, C-terminal = K77 & K78


Q6. Describe the main-chain hydrogen-bonding pattern in an α-helix. 
    Include the atom names and residue numbers for the interacting atoms.

Answer: The h-bond pattern is between every 4th residue.
    N->C direction: E59(O)-K63(N), D60-H64, L61-G65, K62-V66,
    K63-T67, H64-V68, G65-L69, V66-T70, T67-A71, V68-L72,
    L69-G73, T70-A74, A71-I75, L72-L76, G73-K77, (missing? A74-K78)


Q7. Is this helix left-handed or right-handed?
Answer: Right-handed


Q8. Describe how the secondary structure elements are 
    arranged – are the helices parallel or have different orientations?

Answer: Helices have mostly different orientations, 
    with a few pairs being (anti)parallel.


Q9. Where are the hydrophobic side chains mostly located? 
    Why? Where are the water molecules? What does this tell 
    you about the properties of the surface of myoglobin?

Answer: Hydrophobic side chains are mostly on the inside. Since the 
    protein, in vivo, is in water, polar side chains face outward and 
    non-polar face inward, i.e. away from the surrounding water.


Q10. Which residue in the protein is involved in coordinating 
    the heme iron? What is the closest distance between this 
    residue and iron?

Answer: Closest residue is H93 (Histidine 93).
    Closest distance to Fe is 2.1 Å.


Q11. How are the globin-fold subunits packed together 
    in a tetramer – can you find a 4-fold symmetry or is 
    this a “dimer of dimers”?

Answer: Hemoglobin looks like two subunits with six helices, and
    two subunits with five helices.


Q12. Compare the folds of myoglobin and hemoglobin. 
    How similar are the two structures, visually and by the RMS value?

Answer: They look very similar. 
    Excecutive RMSD = 1.250 (124 to 124 atoms).


Q13. How would you describe the tertiary structure?
Answer: Seven a-helices anti-parallel to each other.


Q14. Where are the hydrophobic side chains mostly located? 
    Why? Compare with your observations in Q9.
Answer: Hydrophobic side chains are spread throughout the middle 
    of the structure, but not at the ends. Compared to a globular protein
    this feels more like a membrane protein.


Q15. You are a scientist studying the function of neuroglobin. 
    You want to know how its structure compares to structures of 
    myoglobin and hemoglobin. You have access to the pdb file and 
    to a computer running PyMOL. What would you do?

Answer: Visually compare the protein structures.
    Align the structures and compare RMSD values.
    Global sequence alignment.


Q16. In this tutorial, you have displayed proteins in different 
    representations. Describe for what type of analysis the 
    following display options are useful:
a) all-atom representation (“lines” or “sticks”)
    Interactions between specific atoms.
b) cartoon representation
    Secondary structures.
c) space-filling (“spheres”) or surface representation
    Volume/pockets and polar/non-polar areas.
