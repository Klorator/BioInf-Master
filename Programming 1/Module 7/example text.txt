Mitochondria are present in all eukaryotic cells (for a review, see 'Origin and diversification of mitochondria', Roger et al.), 
where among many other functions it supplies the cells with chemical energy (ATP). Here, we will focus on the genes present in mitochondria; 
mitochondrial genomes present the advantage of being relatively small compared to nuclear genomes (e.g. 16,000 base pairs in humans), 
facilitating bioinformatic operations in the labs. They are also present in many copies in the cells, thus they are relatively easy to sequence 
even in extreme cases where DNA is often limited such as environmental DNA or ancient DNA studies. 
Although mitochondrial genomes can take many different forms depending on the species, they all contain a series of conserved protein-coding genes 
as well as rRNA and tRNA; this makes mitochondrial genomes good candidates for comparative analyses between different species.
