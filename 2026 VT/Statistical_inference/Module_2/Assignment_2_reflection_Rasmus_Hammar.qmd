## Reflections

a)

I feel like I was missing how to actually calculate the p-value for this method.

b)

Yes.

c)

Yes.

d)

Bootstrap confidence interval is just a "we did this x-many times and this is how often we say these results" type of analysis. It doesn't provide a "proper" statistically derived probability which would require a much larger original sample.

e)

It was interesting getting to do more excercises for the resampling and calculate the p-value.

f)

It was fine.

g)

It was good.

h)

Spent more time on this but think it's still less than 20 hours.
